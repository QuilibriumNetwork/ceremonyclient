//!
//! Split of responsibilities with `WorkerAllocator`:
//! - `WorkerAllocator::on_new_frame`: reconciles registry state with
//! running workers (assigns filters to idle cores, clears stale
//! filters). Pure state sync, no proposals.
//! - `ProverLifecycle::evaluate`: examines registry + worker state
//! and returns the full list of actions to submit this frame
//! (matching Go's `evaluateForProposals`, which can emit Propose

//! through the submission pipeline; per-address locking in the
//! consensus engine serializes them so only one takes effect per
//! affected prover address per frame. The single cooldown timer
