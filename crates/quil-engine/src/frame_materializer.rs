//! Frame materializer — applies finalized global frames to local state.
//!
//! When a global frame is finalized (via 2-chain HotStuff), the
//! materializer:
//! 1. Commits the hypergraph at the frame number
//! 2. Verifies the prover tree root against the frame's commitment
//! 3. Triggers HyperSync on mismatch
//! 4. Processes all frame requests through the execution manager
//! 5. Applies state transitions to the prover registry
//! 6. Prunes orphan joins
//! 7. Evicts inactive provers (archive mode only)
//! 8. Persists alt shard updates
//! 9. Publishes snapshot for worker sync
