//! Shard coverage tracking. Partial port of
//! `node/consensus/global/coverage_monitor.go`.
//!
//! Quilibrium uses a "coverage" signal on each shard — if the number
//! of active provers on a shard drops to or below a halt threshold,
//! eviction of inactive provers is suspended so the surviving provers
//! don't kick each other out in a cascading failure.
//!
//! This module ports the data-structure and halt-duration
//! computation parts of the Go `CoverageMonitor`:
//!
//! - [`CoverageStreak`] tracks how long a shard has been in a
//! low-coverage state.
//! - [`LowCoverageStreakTracker`] manages the per-shard streak map,
//! providing `bump`, `clear`, and snapshot methods.
//! - [`CoverageThresholds`] captures the mainnet vs testnet halt
//! parameters.
//! - [`compute_shard_halt_durations`] walks per-shard summaries +
//! the streak map and returns the eviction-suppression duration
//! map used by `evict_inactive_provers`.
//!
//! The event-distribution + async coverage-check-loop plumbing from
//! the Go side is left for a later port — it requires infrastructure
//! (event distributor, hypergraph iteration, async task supervision)
//! that isn't wired into quil-engine yet.
