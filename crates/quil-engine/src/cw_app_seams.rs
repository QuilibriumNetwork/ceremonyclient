//! Real-state implementations of the commonware-simplex consensus seams for
//! APP-SHARD consensus (P3). Analogous to [`crate::cw_global_seams`] but for the
//! per-shard chains. See `crates/quil-cw-consensus/CUTOVER.md` §7.
//!
//! Structural differences from the global path (why this can't be a copy-paste):
//! - The app leader provider (`AppLeaderProvider`) is PRIVATE to `app_engine.rs`
//! and tightly coupled to the engine (it shares the `frame_requests` map and
//! `halted` flag). So instead of extracting it, the CW app path is activated
//! INSIDE `AppConsensusEngine::start_consensus`, reusing the `Arc<dyn
//! LeaderProvider<AppShardState>>` already built there.
//! - The full `AppShardFrame{header, requests}` cannot be rebuilt from the
//! consensus `State` alone — the `requests` live in the engine's per-frame
//! `frame_requests` map. So the engine supplies an ASSEMBLER callback that
//! turns a produced `State<AppShardState>` into the full frame.
//! - `verify` only needs the header (`BlsAppFrameValidator::validate_proposal`
//! checks VDF + structure, not requests), but the block shipped to peers must
//! carry the FULL frame so `on_finalized` can materialize it.
//!
//! The three commonware seam traits are reused verbatim from
//! `quil_cw_consensus::adapters` — they are generic over the 32-byte `Sha256`
//! digest, so the `Global*` naming is incidental.
