//! Forest-native hypergraph CRDT.
//!
//! The state-commitment authority is the [`quil_forest::Forest`] (a hash-Merkle
//! JMT), NOT a KZG vector-commitment trie. Each shard has four independent JMT
//! phase trees (the OR-set: vertex/hyperedge × adds/removes); their four
//! 32-byte roots are the header `state_roots`.
//!
//! Two stores work together, and neither is a KZG trie:
//! - **The forest** holds the *commitment* — each vertex's fields flattened
//! into Level-3 leaves (`l3_leaf_key(id, field_key)`), so a branch commit is
//! a hash, not a G1 multiexp. An empty value is a tombstone leaf keyed by the
//! id (OR-set `removes` / add-side placeholder) so the phase root reflects
//! removals.
//! - **The `HypergraphStore` KV keyspace** holds the per-vertex *blobs*
//! (`save_vertex_underlying`/`load_vertex_underlying_raw`), keyed by id and
//! RocksDB-prefix-scannable. Reads (`get_vertex_data`) and the PoRep /
//! shard-info path navigation read from here — plain key-value, no trie.
//!
//! Mutations stage leaf deltas + blobs in memory; `commit` applies the deltas
//! to the forest (JMT `put_value_set` is natively incremental) and persists the
//! blobs, staging forest writes + the durable materialization cursor into one
//! atomic `Transaction` so they can never diverge.
